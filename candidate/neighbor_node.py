#This should be the only file you edit. You are free to look at other files for reference, but do not change them.
#Below are are two methods which you must implement: euclidean_dist_to_origin and nearest_neighbor as well as the main function beacon handling. 
#Helper Functions are allowed, but not required. You must not change the imports, the main function signature, or the return value of the main function.


"""
Neighbor Table

Listen on UDP 127.0.0.1:5005 for beacon messages:
  {"id":"veh_XXX","pos":[x,y],"speed":mps,"ts":epoch_ms}

Collect beacons for ~1 second starting from the *first* message.
Then print exactly ONE JSON line and exit:

{
  "topic": "/v2x/neighbor_summary",
  "count": <int>,
  "nearest": {"id": "...", "dist": <float>} OR null,
  "ts": <now_ms>
}

Constraints:
- Python 3 stdlib only.
- Ignore malformed messages; donâ€™t crash.
- Do NOT listen to ticks (5006).
